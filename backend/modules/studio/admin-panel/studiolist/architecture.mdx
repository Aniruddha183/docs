# Studio Listing Architecture

This document defines the system architecture for managing studio listings, including state transitions and integration with the Owner Profile module.

## 1. System Overview

The Studio Listing module manages the lifecycle of a studio from initial draft to public availability. It acts as a gatekeeper to ensure content quality and owner compliance before a studio is visible to end-users.

## 2. State Machine (Status Flow)

The studio transitions through the following states:

- **DRAFT:** Initial state when an owner starts creating a listing.
- **UNDER_REVIEW:** Submitted by the owner; pending admin action.
- **APPROVED:** Verified by admin; visible on the public platform.
- **REJECTED:** Denied by admin; requires corrections (includes rejection reason).
- **DEACTIVATED:** Hidden from public view by admin due to policy violations.

## 3. Cross-Module Dependency

The architecture implements a **Hard Lock** on the `APPROVED` status.

- **Dependency:** `Studio.status` cannot transition to `APPROVED` unless `Owner.stage === 'APPROVED'`.
- **Implementation:** Backend middleware validates the owner's KYC and profile status during the studio approval API call.
