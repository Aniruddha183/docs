# Business Logic: Studio Listing

This document outlines the rules governing how studios are reviewed, published, and managed by the Admin team.

## 1. The Listing Lifecycle

### Phase A: Submission

1. An owner creates a studio. It resides in **Draft** until they formally click "Submit for Review."
2. Once submitted, it appears in the Admin Panel's **Under Review** queue.

### Phase B: Admin Review

Admins must inspect the studio details (images, pricing, description).

- **Approval Rule:** A studio **CANNOT** be approved if the Owner's profile or KYC is not yet approved.
- **Rejection Rule:** If an admin rejects a studio, they **must** provide a reason (e.g., "Blurry photos," "Invalid address"). This reason is sent via notification to the Owner App.

## 2. Public Availability

- A studio becomes "Public" (bookable by users) **ONLY** when its status is `APPROVED`.
- If a studio is in any other state (Draft, Under Review, Rejected, Deactivated), it is stripped from search results and direct links.

## 3. Administrative Operations

### Studio Deactivation

Admin has the power to **Deactivate** a studio at any time if:

- Illegal content is found on the studio wall.
- Multiple user complaints are received.
- The studio no longer meets platform standards.
  _Effect:_ The studio remains in the database for record-keeping but is immediately removed from the public website.

### Editing & Management

- **Manual Overrides:** Admins can edit studio details (correcting typos, updating categories) to maintain platform quality.
- **Analytics:** Admins can view performance metrics (Total bookings, Revenue generated, Page views) for each studio to identify top-performing partners.
- **Review Management:** Admins can view all user-submitted reviews and ratings to monitor studio quality.

## 4. Validation Rules Summary

| Trigger                   | Logic                                                                    |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On Approval**           | Check `owner.stage`. If not "Approved", block approval and notify admin. |
| **On Rejection**          | `rejectReason` field is mandatory.                                       |
| **On Owner Deactivation** | All associated studios must automatically inherit a `Inactive` state.    |
| **On Deactivation**       | Cancel or flag upcoming bookings associated with that studio.            |

## 5. Permission Matrix

- **View Listings:** All Admins.
- **Edit/Review Studios:** Support Admins and Super Admins.
- **Delete/Deactivate Studios:** Super Admins or Compliance Officers only.
