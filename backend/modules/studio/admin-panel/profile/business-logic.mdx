description: This document defines the rules governing Studio Owner onboarding, verification, and lifecycle management.
---

## 1. Onboarding Workflow

When a Studio Owner completes registration:

1. The profile appears in the **Admin Profile Management** list.
2. The initial status is set to **Pending Review**.
3. All associated Studios are **Unpublished** by default.

## 2. Review & Approval Process

Admins can open a detailed view (DIM/Modal) to review:

- Personal Details (Name, Contact, Email).
- Business Documents (KYC).
- Listed Studios associated with the owner.

### Decision Matrix

| Action         | Condition                       | Outcome                                                   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approve**    | KYC valid + Contract Successful | Profile active; Studios can be published.                 |
| **Reject**     | Invalid documents/Fake info     | Profile rejected; Owner notified via Email.               |
| **Deactivate** | Misbehavior / Policy violation  | Profile marked INACTIVE; All studios hidden from website. |

## 3. KYC & Razor Pay Integration

The KYC process is tied directly to payment eligibility:

1. **Contract Initiation:** Admin reviews KYC docs. If valid, Admin triggers a Razor Pay contract.
2. **Verification Logic:**
   - If Razor Pay returns **Success**: KYC status = `Approved`. Owner can now receive payments.
   - If Razor Pay returns **Fail**: KYC status = `Rejected`. Admin must re-evaluate or ask for new docs.

## 4. Administrative Power Levels

### Super Admin

- **Payment Agreements:** Exclusive power to add or modify payment terms/commissions based on 1-on-1 discussions with owners.
- **System Overrides:** Can reactivate profiles deactivated by standard admins.

### Admin

- **Review:** Can view and audit all owner details and studio listings.
- **Enforcement:** Can **Deactivate** any owner profile for misbehavior.
- **Impact:** Deactivating an owner performs a **Cascade Unpublish** on all studios owned by that individual.

## 5. Studio Visibility Logic

Studio visibility on the public website is dependent on the Owner's Profile status:

- `Profile: Approved` + `Studio: Published` = **Visible**
- `Profile: Inactive` = **Hidden** (regardless of studio status)
- `Profile: Pending/Rejected` = **Hidden**

## 6. API Permissions

Every operation is gated by permissions:

- **List Profiles:** `GET /api/v1/admin/profiles` (Allowed: Admin, Super Admin)
- **Update Status:** `PATCH /api/v1/admin/profiles/:id/status` (Allowed: Admin, Super Admin)
- **Manage Agreements:** `POST /api/v1/admin/agreements` (Allowed: Super Admin ONLY)
