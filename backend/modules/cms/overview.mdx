# CMS Module Overview

## Purpose

The Content Management System (CMS) is responsible for managing and serving **static and semi-static content** across FitnEarn platforms.  
It enables admins to create, update, and manage content, while allowing public platforms to consume and display that content without modification.

The CMS acts as a **central source of truth for content**, independent of frontend presentation or platform-specific UI behavior.

---

## Types of Content

The CMS currently supports the following content types:

### 1. ContactFooter

Structured content used for:

- Website footer information
- Contact details
- FAQs
- Legal or support-related static information

This content type follows a **fixed structure** and is rendered differently by consuming platforms based on their UI requirements.

---

### 2. GeneralContent

Flexible, free-form content used for:

- About Us pages
- Informational or marketing pages
- CMS-driven static sections

This content type allows rich text and dynamic layouts and is stored in a generic format to support multiple renderers.

---

## Content Scope

Each content entry is scoped by:

- **Content Type** (ContactFooter or GeneralContent)
- **Application Type** (e.g., FitnEarn Website, FitnEarn Pal, FitCart, FitnEarn Studio)

This allows the same CMS to serve different platforms while keeping content logically separated.

---

## Consumers of CMS

### Admin Panel

- Admin users manage content through protected APIs
- Access is controlled via **permission-based authorization**
- Depending on assigned permissions, an admin may:
  - Create content
  - Read content
  - Update content
  - Delete content

There is no separate admin role hierarchy; permissions define capabilities.

---

### Public Platforms (Website, Mobile, etc.)

- Public platforms consume content through **read-only public APIs**
- No authentication is required for public access
- Public platforms cannot modify content
- Content visibility is determined by:
  - The API being accessed
  - The application type of the content

There is **no internal publish/unpublish state** for content.

---

## Key Characteristics

- CMS content does **not** have lifecycle states such as Draft, Published, or Rejected
- Visibility is controlled entirely through **API boundaries and permissions**
- All content fields are **mutable** via update APIs
- Content behavior is **type-driven**, not state-driven

---

## Non-Goals

The CMS module does **not**:

- Control frontend layouts or styling
- Manage publishing workflows or approval states
- Handle user-generated content
- Enforce content versioning

---

## Future Considerations (High-Level)

- Additional content types may be introduced
- New application types may be added
- Public consumption rules may evolve, but without introducing content states
- CMS behavior should remain independent of frontend rendering logic

Detailed evolution rules are documented in **Future Considerations**.
