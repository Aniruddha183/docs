# CMS Public Platform Business Logic

## Purpose

This document defines **how public platforms (Website and similar consumers)** should interpret, handle, and render CMS content received from public APIs.

It describes **expected behavior**, not API contracts or backend implementation.

---

## Public Consumption Model

Public platforms:

- Consume CMS content via **read-only public APIs**
- Do not modify content
- Do not manage content state or lifecycle
- Render content based on **type** and **applicationType**

There is no publishing workflow or visibility state managed by CMS.

---

## Content Interpretation Rules

### Content Type Handling

Public platforms must interpret content based on its `type`.

---

#### ContactFooter

When content type is `ContactFooter`:

- Content is treated as **structured data**
- Typical usage includes:
  - Footer text
  - Contact information
  - FAQs
- Platforms should:
  - Render only relevant fields
  - Ignore missing or unused fields gracefully
  - Avoid assuming the presence of all sub-fields

---

#### GeneralContent

When content type is `GeneralContent`:

- Content is treated as **free-form informational data**
- The `description` field represents the primary content
- Platforms are responsible for:
  - Rendering the description appropriately
  - Handling formatting or structured text if applicable

CMS does not enforce or interpret the content format.

---

## Application Type Handling

Each content entry is associated with an `applicationType`.

Public platforms must:

- Consume only content relevant to their application scope
- Ignore content entries intended for other platforms
- Avoid rendering content with mismatched application types

Filtering may occur either:

- At the API level
- Or at the frontend level, depending on integration

---

## Update and Change Tolerance

Public platforms must be tolerant to:

- Changes in content structure
- Optional fields being added or removed
- Content type changes made by admins

Platforms must **not assume**:

- Stability of content shape beyond documented fields
- That a content type will remain unchanged over time

---

## Error Handling Expectations

Public platforms should:

- Gracefully handle missing content
- Handle empty responses without breaking UI
- Treat `404` responses as valid “content not available” cases

Public platforms must not attempt retries for logical errors.

---

## Non-Goals

This document does **not** describe:

- Admin workflows or permissions
- API endpoint definitions
- Database schema or persistence rules
- Frontend design or styling decisions
