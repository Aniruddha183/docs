# CMS Admin Business Logic

## Purpose

This document defines **how CMS content behaves when accessed or modified by admin users**.  
It explains **type-driven behavior**, **side effects of admin actions**, and **how permissions influence outcomes**.

This document focuses on **behavior**, not API contracts or database structure.

---

## Admin Capabilities Overview

Admin behavior is governed by **permissions**, not roles.

Depending on assigned permissions, an admin may:

- Create content
- Read content
- Update content
- Delete content

There is no separate lifecycle state for content (e.g., Draft or Published).

---

## Content Type–Driven Behavior

CMS supports multiple content types.  
The behavior of admin actions depends on the selected **content type**.

---

### ContactFooter Content

ContactFooter content represents **structured informational data**.

When managing ContactFooter content:

- Admins may update:
  - Footer description
  - Contact details
  - FAQs
- FAQs are managed **as part of the content**, not independently
- Adding, editing, or removing FAQs updates the entire content entry

There is no restriction on modifying ContactFooter content after creation.

---

### GeneralContent Content

GeneralContent represents **free-form informational content**.

When managing GeneralContent:

- Admins may update the content description at any time
- The description may represent structured or rich text
- The CMS does not interpret or validate content structure beyond basic storage

---

## Update Behavior and Side Effects

### Updating Content

When an admin updates content:

- Only fields provided in the request are modified
- Fields not included in the request remain unchanged
- Updating content does **not** create a new version or copy

The following fields are **fully mutable**:

- `title`
- `type`
- `applicationType`
- `fitnearnFooter`
- `contactDetails`
- `faqs`
- `description`

---

### Changing Content Type

Admins may change the content type after creation.

Behavior when changing `type`:

- Fields irrelevant to the new type may be ignored by consuming platforms
- CMS does not automatically remove previously stored fields
- Responsibility for rendering relevant fields lies with consuming platforms

---

### Changing Application Type

Admins may update the `applicationType` of existing content.

Behavior:

- The content becomes associated with the new application scope
- Visibility via public APIs is determined by application type
- No historical linkage to previous application type is maintained

---

## Deletion Behavior

When content is deleted:

- The deletion is **permanent**
- No soft-delete or recovery mechanism exists
- All associated FAQs are deleted with the content

---

## Permission-Based Constraints

- Admins without delete permission cannot remove content
- Admins without update permission cannot modify content
- Read-only admins may only view content

CMS does not partially apply changes if permission checks fail.

---

## Error and Validation Behavior

- Permission validation occurs **before** any content modification
- Invalid input data results in request rejection
- CMS does not perform cross-content validation (each content entry is independent)

---

## Non-Goals

This document does **not** describe:

- API endpoint details
- Database schema
- Public content consumption behavior
- Frontend rendering logic
